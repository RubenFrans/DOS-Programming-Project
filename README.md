# DOS-Programming-Project
This repository contains the code of programming experiments created in order to learn programming for MS-DOS.
Please be aware that this is code is written on an almost 30 year old operating system using an almost 30 year old C++ compiler and software.
Thus this code base can contain old and weird coding standards in comparisson to modern C++ standards.

## Hardware and software
All code in this repository can be compiled using the Borland C++ IDE version 2.0 running under MS-DOS.
All code was written on a i386-dx2 PC and uses VGA Graphics and BIOS interrupts for drawing in GRAPHICS MODE (mode 13)
An alternative to compiling and running this code is using DOSBOX.

## Projects
### Line Drawing
The line drawing project is a simple project that demonstrates a few core concepts of writting to the VGA buffer and using bios interreptus to draw lines and pixels on the screen.
### Game / Game Engine (SPARTAN)
The SPARTAN project is a more elaborate project where I'm aiming to create a small game / game engine this project is still in the early stages of developemnt but has some WIP classes for renderering.
