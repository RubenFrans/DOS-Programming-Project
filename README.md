# DOS-Programming-Project
This repository contains the code of programming experiments created in order to learn programming for MS-DOS.
Please be aware that this is code for an almost 30 year old operating system using an almost 30 year old C++ compiler.
Thus this code base can contain old and weird coding standards in comparisson to modern C++ standards.

## Hardware and software
All code in this repository can be compiled using the Borland C++ IDE version 2.0 running under MS-DOS.
All code was written on a i386-dx2 PC and uses VGA Graphics and BIOS interrupts for drawing in GRAPHICS MODE (mode 13)
An alternative to compiling and running this code is using DOSBOX.
